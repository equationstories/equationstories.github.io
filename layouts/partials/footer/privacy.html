                       them (cf. also Art. 17 DSGVO), or, alternatively, if further processing is necessary as 
                       stipulated in Art. 17 Para. 3 GDPR, to restrict said processing per Art. 18 GDPR;</li> <li>to 
                       receive copies of the data concerning them and/or provided by them and to have the same 
                       transmitted to other providers/controllers (cf. also Art. 20 GDPR);</li> <li>to file 
                       complaints with the supervisory authority if they believe that data concerning them is

                       (see also Art. 77 GDPR).</li> </ul> <p>In addition, the controller is obliged to inform

                       placed on processing the same per Art. 16, 17 Para. 1, 18 GDPR. However, this obligation does 
                       not apply if such notification is impossible or involves a disproportionate effort. Nevertheless, 
                       users have a right to information about these recipients.</p> <p><strong>Likewise, under Art. 
                       21 GDPR, users and data subjects have the right to object to the controller's future processing 
                       of their data pursuant to Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. In particular, an objection to data processing

                       <p>We also integrate the following social media and publishing service sites into our website. 
                        The integration 
                       takes place via simple links or a linked graphic of the respective site. The use of these 
                       graphics stored 
                       on our own servers prevents the automatic connection to the servers of these networks for their 
                       display. Only by clicking on the corresponding graphic will you be forwarded to the service of 
                       the respective social network.</p>

                       site. It cannot be ruled out that such data will be processed in the United States.</p> 
                       
                       <p>Initially, this data includes such things as your IP address, the date and time of your 
                       visit, and the page visited. If you are logged into your user account on that network, 
                       however, the network operator might assign the information collected about your visit 
                       to our site to your personal account. If you interact by clicking Like, Share, etc., 
                       this information can be stored your personal user account and possibly posted on the 
                       respective network. To prevent this, you need to log out of your social media account 
                       before clicking on the graphic. The various social media networks also offer settings that y
                       ou can configure accordingly.</p>

                        <p>
                        We use the service jQuery CDN, a Content Delivery Network („CDN“), 
                        on our website to optimise the retrieval speed, the design and presentation 
                        of the content of our website on different devices. 
                        
                        This is a service of the jQuery Foundation, hereinafter referred to as „jQuery“. 
                        jQuery is distributed for the JS Foundation via the StackPath CDN.
                        
                        In order to be able to deliver the content of our website quickly, 
                        the service uses so-called JavaScript libraries. Relevant files are 
                        loaded from the CDN server if they are not already available in your 
                        browser cache when you visit another website. In the case of a connection 
                        to the CDN server, your IP address is recorded. It cannot be ruled out that 
                        a connection will be established to a server outside the EU.
                        
                        The legal basis is Art.  6 para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. Our legitimate interest 
                        lies in speeding up loading times and protecting our website, as well as 
                        in analysing and optimising our website.
                        
                        To totally prevent the execution of jQuery's JavaScript code, you can 
                        install a so-called JavaScript blocker, such as noscript.net or ghostery.com. 
                        If you were to prevent or restrict the execution of the Java Script code, 
                        this can mean that for technical reasons not all the content and functions 
                        of our website may be available.

                        of the content of our website on different devices.  This is an open source
